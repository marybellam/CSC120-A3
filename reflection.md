- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with my classmates Julia and Kim.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the wednesday session on February 15.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
My initial impressions are that I like java better than python because its easier to debug and not as dependent on indintation. It also runs faster which is very helpful.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
A conclusion I can draw about programming in general from the smiliarities is that you can do the same things in multiple coding languages, but each language has their advantages and disadvantages. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was getting the random int to work but what didn't work was the mirror words which was very hard for me to graps. My advice would again be to go to TA hours sooner in the week.
